# Cybersecurity Python Scripts Portfolio

This portfolio is a collection of offensive cybersecurity scripts coded in python and developed in the Kali Linux environment. Some scripts need modifying before they can be used, such as the dns_spoof.py script (need to enter the target site and ip address manually).

There are still a number of scripts and topics which are currently being worked on and will be added once they are complete.

Scripts in Progress:
- file interceptor
- code injector
- ARP spoof detector
- malware (keyloggers, backdoor)
- bypassing HTTPS
- web app related scripts
- vulnerability scanner


Completed Scripts:
- MAC address changer
- DNS spoofer
- ARP spoofer
- Network Scanner
- Packet Sniffer
